%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX

	 The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique for obtaining approximate solutions to boundary-value-problems of mathmatical physics, such like Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Compared with finite difference method, FEM is very competitive when solving two-dimensional and three-dimensional PDEs with complicated geometry and mesh. Hence it plays a very important role in electromagnetic analysis. In this paper, I first formulate the finite element solution for a general one-dimensional and a general two-dimensional boundary-value problem (Poisson's Equation) using Ritz's method and linear elements. Then I study the higher order element, such as quadratic and cubic interpolation. Finally I illustrate the application of FEM on Electrostatic and Transmission Line problems in two-dimensional case.

Electromagnetic analysis has been an indispensable part of many engineering and scientific studies since J.C.Maxwell published his electromagnetic theory in 1873. The problem of electromagnetic analysis is basically solving a set of Maxwell's equations subject to boundary conditions${^{[1]}}$. In the past 200 years people developed a lot of methods to solve boundary-value Maxwell's equations analytically, such as using Green's fuction with vector potential. However, the mathematical models of most physical problems are so complicated that an analytical or closed-form solution is often not available, especially for nonlinear problem in optics and photonics area. For this reason, numerical methods are introduced to help solve these linear or nonlinear PDEs. The well-known numerical methods consist of difference method like finite difference (FD) and FEM, integral method like method of moment (MoM) and others like spectrum method. For electromagnetic problems, there are more methods like finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD), Beam tracing method and transmission line model method (TLM). Today, the finite element method has been very well developed for two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems and widely used in electromagnetic reseach, since many famous commercial softwares use FEM as their main algorithm, such like COMSOL, ANSYS, CST and so forth. 
Instead of having intuitive scheme like finite difference method, FEM is based on more complex mathematical theorem. As is discussed, for solving the boundary-value electromagnetic problems it is hard to find the analytical solution in most of cases. To overcome this difficulty, various of approximate methods have been developed, among which Ritz and Galerkin's methods have been used most widely. The basic idea of these two methods is selecting trial functions (or test functions) defined over the entire solution domain that can represent the true solution, at least approxiamately, and satisfy the proper boundary conditions. However, for many problems it is still very difficult to find the appropriate test functions, if not impossible, especially for two- and three- dimensional problems. To alleviate this diffuculty, we can divide the entire domain into several small subdomains and use trial functions defined over each subdomain. In this case such trial functions are usually simpler than entire-domain and we can use interpolation method to form these trial functions on each subregion. Hence, a finite element analysis of a boundary-value problem should include the following steps:\\
1. Discretization the entire domain into subdomains;\\
2. Selection of the interpolation functions (trial functions);\\
3. Formulation of the system of equations via Ritz or Galerkin's method;\\
4. Solution of the system of equations.\\ 
I will discuss the above steps in the following sections in great detail. In secion II, I introduce Ritz's method of formulation; in section III, I discuss the discretizing method and interpolation scheme; in section IV, I will show how to formulate the system of equations created from discretization and how to deal with three kinds of boundary conditions. In section V, there are the numerical solutions to PDEs solved by FEM. Those problems include basic 1D and 2D poisson's equations with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condtions, electrostatic problem, as well as the analysis of microstrip and quasistatic transmission line. Note that transmission line plays a significant role in communication engineering, thus using numerical method to study the electromagnetic properties of it helps us with better understanding.

\section{The variational theorem and Ritz Method}

\subsection{Formulation of the Differential Equation}
We start with a differential equation of the following form:

Under the domain $\Omega$ with boundary $\Gamma$:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \phi = f
\end{equation}

From equation (1), $\mathcal{L}$ denotes the differential equation, $\phi$ is the variable, and f is the excitation source. For electromagnetic problems, the form of governing differential equation ranges from simple Poisson equations, like electrostatic problem, to complicated scalar and vector wave equations, like antenna problem. 

To formulate the system matrix with the Ritz method, we must first define the inner product for functions inside the solution space:

\begin{equation}
\langle \phi, \psi \rangle = \int_{\Omega}\phi \psi^* d\Omega
\end{equation}
\\where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. With the definition of inner product it can be shown that if the operator  $\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint, the solution of (1) can be obtained by minimizing the functional 
%The Ritz method relies on the minimization of the \textit{functional} of the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
F(\widetilde{\phi}) = \frac{1}{2} \langle \mathcal{L}\widetilde{\phi}, \widetilde{\phi} \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \langle \widetilde{\phi}, f \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \langle f,\widetilde{\phi} \rangle
\end{equation}

Here we deploy $\widetilde{\phi}$ instead of $\phi$ - where $\widetilde{\phi}$ is the trial (test) function. The test function we use in FEM represent a weak solution - a guess to the real solution. The $\widetilde{\phi}$ can be discretized and approximated by the expansion:

\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\phi} \approx \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i v_i = C^T V = V^T C 
\end{equation}

In the expansion above, the $v_i$ are chosen basis function over the entire domain, and $c_i$ are its coefficients. So C and V are column vectors. Combining equation (3) and (4), we have

\begin{equation}
F(\widetilde{\phi}) = \frac{1}{2}C^T \int_{\Omega}V \mathcal{L} V^T d\Omega C - C^T \int_{\Omega} V f d\Omega
\end{equation}

In order to minimize the functionals, we just need to set all of the partial derivatives of f to be zero:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial C_i} & = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega}V L V^T d\Omega C + \frac{1}{2} C^T \int_\Omega V L V_i d\Omega - \int_{\Omega}V_i f d\Omega\\
& = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{N} C_j \int_{\Omega} (V_i \mathcal{L} V_j + V_j \mathcal{L} V_i ) d\Omega - \int_\Omega V_i f d\Omega \\
& = 0 \hspace{1cm} \forall i \in [0,\dots,N]
\end{split}\end{equation}
which can be written as the matrix format:
\begin{equation}
MC = b
\end{equation}
The matrix M can be composed as follow:

\begin{equation}
M_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega}(V_i \mathcal{L} V_j + V_j \mathcal{L} V_i) d\Omega
\end{equation}

The column vector b can be composed as follow:

\begin{equation}
b_i = \int_{\Omega} V_i f d\Omega
\end{equation}



\section{Discretizing and Inerpolation  method}
\subsection{Discretization of the entire domain}
As is discussed in I, finding the appropriate trial function for the hole domain is hard, hence we need to discretize the entire domain for simplification. Actually, the discretization is perhaps the most important step in any finite element analysis because the manner in which the domian is discretized will affected the computer storage requirement, CPU time, and especially the accuracy of numerical result. In this step, the entire domain $\Omega$ is divided into M subdomains $\Omega^e$ which is always referred to as \textit{element}. For a one-dimensional domain, the elements are always short line segmentations to form (at least approximately) the original line; for a two-dimensional domain, the elements are often triangles (for irregular region) and rectangles (for regular region). In a three-dimensional problem, the domain can be discretized into tetrahedra, triangular prisms, or rectangular bricks. Figure 3.1 shows these discretization schemes.

The domain discretization is always considered as the preprocessing task because it can be completely seperated from the other steps. Therefore, many well-developed finite element programs are created and open sourced to us. In this project I used gmsh as the mesh generator to discretize the entire domain for 2D cases.

\subsection{Selection of Interpolation Functions}
The second step of finite element analysis is the selection of an interpolation function that provides an approxiamation of the unknown solution within an element. The interpolation can be a polynomial of first (linear), second (quadratic), third (cubic) or higher order. The higher the order is, the more accurate the interpolation can be, while the interpolation formula will be more complicated. Once the order of the polynomial is selected, we can derive an expression for the unknown solution in an element in the following form:
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\phi} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} N^e_j {\phi}^e_j = \{N^e\}^T\{\phi^e\}
\end{equation}
where n is the number of nodes in each element;  ${{\phi}^e_j}$ is the value of ${\phi}$ at node j in the element; and ${N^e_j}$ is the interpolation function (or basis function) for node j which has the polynomial form. The most important feature of functions ${N^e_j}$ is that they are nonzero only within the element e, and outside this element they must vanish, due to the feature of Hilbert space. Another thing we need to note is that the order of the interpolation functions ${N^e_j}$ is the same as the order of element. In this paper I used Linear, quadratic and cubic interpolation for 1D problem and only linear interpolation for 2d cases.   


\section{Formulation and Boundary condition}
\subsection{Formulation via Ritz Method}
The third step in a finite element analysis is to formulate the system of equations. Reconsider the equation (1) and for simplicity assume that the problem is real valued. When the entire domain is discretized into subdomains, The \textit{functional} function F(${\widetilde{\phi}}$) defined in (3) can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
F(\widetilde{\phi}) = \sum_{e=1}^{M} F^e(\widetilde{\phi}^e) 
\end{equation}
where M is the number of elements making up the entire domian and
\begin{equation}
F^e(\widetilde{\phi}^e) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega^e} \widetilde{\phi}^e \mathcal{L} \widetilde{\phi}^e d\Omega -\int_{\Omega^e} f \widetilde{\phi}^e d\Omega
\end{equation}
where ${{\Omega^e}}$ is the domain of each element. Substituting the interpolation scheme (10) into (12), we obtain
\begin{equation}
F^e =  \{\phi^e\}^T \{\frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega^e}\{N^e\}\mathcal{L}\{N^e\}^Td{\Omega}\{\phi^e\} - \int_{\Omega^e}f\{N^e\}d{\Omega}\}
\end{equation}
which can be written in matrix form as 
\begin{equation}
F^e = \frac{1}{2} \{\phi^e\}^T[K^e]\{\Phi^e\} - \{\Phi^e\}^T\{b^e\}
\end{equation}
where ${[K^e]}$ is an n ${\times}$ n matrix while {b$^e$} an n  ${\times}$ 1 vector, n is the number of nodes in an element. The elements in ${[K^e]}$ and {b$^e$} are
\begin{equation}
K^e_{ij} = \int_{\Omega^e}N^e_i \mathcal{L}N^e_j d\Omega
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
b^e_i = \int_{\Omega^e}fN^e_i d\Omega
\end{equation}
Note that since ${\mathcal{L}}$ is self-adjoint, matrix [K$^e$] is symmetric. Substituting (14) to (11), we can obtain the formula of F in the entire domain as
\begin{equation}
F(\widetilde{\phi}) = \sum_{e=1}^{M} (\frac{1}{2}\{\phi^e\}^T[K^e]\{\phi^e\} - \{\phi^e\}^T\{b^e\})
\end{equation}
By performing the summation and replacing the local node numbers with the global node numbers, (17) can be written as
\begin{equation}
F = \frac{1}{2}\{\phi\}^T[K]\{\phi\}-\{\phi\}^T\{b\}
\end{equation}
where [K] is an N ${\times}$ N matrix, with N being the total number of nodes in the entire domain; ${\{\phi\}}$ is an N ${\times}$ 1 vector referring to the unknown value on these nodes;  ${\{b\}}$ is the N ${\times}$ 1 vector standing for source term.  
According to variational theorem, the solution to the system of equations can be obtained by imposing the stationarity requirement $\delta$ F = 0. Here we can equivalently set the partial derivative of F with respect to $\phi_i$ to be zero:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi_i} = \sum_{j=1}^{N}K_{ij}\phi_j - b_i = 0 \hspace{0.5cm} i = 1,2,...,N
\end{equation}
or in a matrix form,
\begin{equation}
[K]\{\phi\} = \{b\}
\end{equation}
With equation (20), we are able to solve the problem via LU decomposition and backward/forward substitution.

\subsection{Application of Boundary Condition}
Before we solve the system of equations, we need to apply the required boundary conditions. There are three kinds of boundary conditions that are often encountered: Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin's boundary condition. The Dirichlet condition is an \textit{essential} boundary condition that must be imposed explicitely; in contrast, the Neumann condition is always satisfied implicitly and automatically in the solution process, hence Neumann condition is also called the \textit{natural boundary condition}. For Robin condition, since it is the linear combination of Dirichlet and Neumann condition, emplicitely implementing is also needed.

\section{Numerical Solution via Finite Element Analysis}
In the foregoing sections I introduced the steps of solving one boundary-valued problem via FEM analytically and numerically. Hence in this section, I will apply the Finite Element Analysis to one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, including electrostatic and transmission line cases.
\subsection{One-dimensional Poisson Equation}
At the first beginning I implement the Finite Element analysis to 1D poisson equation
\begin{equation}
-\frac{d^2\phi}{dt^2} = \pi^2sin(\pi x) \hspace{0.5cm} 0<x<L 
\end{equation} 
Here L = 1, x $\in$[0,L] is the entire domain, with Dirichlet boundary condition
\begin{equation}
\phi|_{x=0} = \phi|_{x=L} = 0
\end{equation}
From the boundary condition we can easily find the analytical solution is 
\begin{equation}
\phi = sin(\pi x) \hspace{0.5cm} 0<x<L 
\end{equation}
Firstly I choose linear element and interpolation, which is 
\begin{equation}
\phi^e(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{2}N_j^e(x)\phi^e_j
\end{equation}
where N$^e_j$ denotes the interpolation function given by
\begin{align*}
N^e_1(x) = \frac{x^e_2-x}{l^e} \hspace{0.5cm} and \hspace{0.5cm} N^e_2(x) = \frac{x-x^e_1}{l^e}
\end{align*}
where l$^e$ is the length of element. Then, formulating via the Ritz method. By intergrating over the element I calculate K$^e_{ij}$ and b$^e_j$ from
\begin{equation}
K^e_{ij} =\int_{x_1^e}^{x_2^e}\frac{dN^e_i}{dx} \frac{dN^e_j}{dx} dx
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
b^e_j = \int_{x_1^e}^{x_2^e}N_i^efdx
\end{equation}
where f = $\pi^2$sin($\pi$x) here, as the source term. 
The next step is assemblying to form the system of equations by a summation over all elements and then an imposition of the stationarity requirement:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{e=1}^{M}([\overline{K}^e]\{\overline{\phi}^e\} - \{\overline{b}^e\}) = \{0\}
\end{equation}
Here I discretized the entire domain into M = 18 elements, with 19 nodes. Having obtained [K] and {b}, I applied the Dirichlet boundary condition by setting the value of $\phi$ at the boundary points to be zero, hence the size of [K] and {b} reduced by 2. Then I solved the vector {$\phi$} by LU decomposition. I also used finite difference menthod to solve the same problem with the same discretization, which is shown in figure 5.1
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{1Dlinear}
\end{figure}
\begin{center}
	\small fig 5.1 FEM and FD solution to one-dimensional Poisson's equation
\end{center} 
To exam the accuracy of FEM and FD, I calculated the L$_\infty$ norm of it. Note that FEM's solution is extremely accurate on each node, hence I choose h$_e$ = h/N as the size of interval to sample the interpolared solution on the whole region. The error distribution (compared with analytical solution with the same sampling frequency) is shown in fig 5.2
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{1dLinearError}
\end{figure}
\begin{center}
	\small fig 5.2 Error distribution from linear interpolation 
\end{center} 
From figure 5.2, the L$_\infty$ norm is 0.0038, while the L$_\infty$ norm of finite difference method is 0.0025. The error of these methods shares the same order of magnitudes. Hence linear interpolation is not with a very high accuracy. To study how the order of interpolation affects the accuracy, I tried quadratic and cubic interpolation as
\begin{equation}
\phi^e_{q}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{3}N_j^e(x)\phi^e_j \hspace{0.2cm} and \hspace{0.2cm} \phi^e_{c}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{4}N_j^e(x)\phi^e_j
\end{equation}
where N$^e_j$ for quadratic interpolation is given by
\begin{align*}
N^e_1(x) = \frac{(x-x^e_2)(x-x^e_3)}{(x^e_1-x^e_2)(x^e_1-x^e_3)} \\
N^e_2(x) = \frac{(x-x^e_1)(x-x^e_3)}{(x^e_2-x^e_1)(x^e_2-x^e_3)} \\
N^e_3(x) = \frac{(x-x^e_1)(x-x^e_2)}{(x^e_3-x^e_1)(x^e_3-x^e_2)}
\end{align*}
while N$^e_j$ for cubic interpolation is given by
\begin{align*}
N^e_1(x) = \frac{(x-x^e_2)(x-x^e_3)(x-x^e_4)}{(x^e_1-x^e_2)(x^e_1-x^e_3)(x^e_1-x^e_4)} \\
N^e_2(x) = \frac{(x-x^e_1)(x-x^e_3)(x-x^e_4)}{(x^e_2-x^e_1)(x^e_2-x^e_3)(x^e_2-x^e_4)} \\
N^e_3(x) = \frac{(x-x^e_1)(x-x^e_2)(x-x^e_4)}{(x^e_3-x^e_1)(x^e_3-x^e_2)(x^e_3-x^e_4)} \\
N^e_4(x) = \frac{(x-x^e_1)(x-x^e_2)(x-x^e_3)}{(x^e_4-x^e_1)(x^e_4-x^e_2)(x^e_4-x^e_3)}
\end{align*}
Using the same size of discretization as N = 18, the L$\infty$ norm of these two interpolation are 3.350e-4 and 3.769e-5, respectively, which is much smaller than both FEM with linear interpolation and finite difference method. The error distribution of the two kinds of interpolation is shown in figure 5.3 and 5.4
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{center}

\end{center} 
I then test the scheme for convergence by doing seven runs. I start with N = 18 (with 19 nodes) and find the L$_\infty$ norm of finite differece method, FEM with linear interpolation, quadratic interpolation as well as cubic interpolation. Then I halve the size of element and repeat the same procedure for 7 runs. The results is shown in Table 5.1 to 5.4

From the convergence analysis we can see that both finite difference method and FEM with linear interpolation are of 2$^{nd}$ order accuracy, quadratic is of 3$^{rd}$ order accuracy while cubic is of 4$^{th}$ order accuracy. Note that for quadratic and cubic interpolation I didn't try as much as 7 runs, that's because the error decreases really fast when I halve the size of element, when it reaches to the order of round-off error as 1e-10, the result will be contaminated. 

\subsection{Two-dimensional Poisson Equation}
With all the effort on one-dimensional case, now we can move to two-dimensional problems. For electromagnetic problems, we always solve it in frequence domain by assuming the EM wave is time-harmonic. In general case, the 2D anisotropic Helmholtz equation can be written as
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \bigg(\alpha_x \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}\bigg) -\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \bigg(\alpha_y \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y}\bigg) + \beta \phi= f
\end{equation}
Where $\phi$ can be electric field, magnetic field, potential or vector potential which satisfies Lorentz condition. 
At the first beginning I solve the equation with the simplest case given as following:
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} = 2\pi^2 sin(\pi x)cos(\pi y)
\end{equation}
where x, y defined on [0,1]$\times$[0,1], with the boundary condition
\begin{align*}
\phi|_{x = 0} = \phi|_{x = 1} = 0 \hspace{0.2cm} and \hspace{0.2cm} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}|_{y = 0} = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}|_{y = 1} = 0
\end{align*}
Therefore the analytical solution is $\phi$ = sin($\pi$x)cos($\pi$y). Solved with linear interpolation, result is shown in figure 5.5, while the analytical solution is shown in figure 5.6

\subsection{Electrostatic Problem:  Electric Potential distribution on a Microstrip Line}
Microstrip Line is widely used in communication system. It consists of a substrate made of dielectric material (such as FR-4) with a metal strip on the top surface of it. The size of it is always in micro-meter, hence is called "microstrip line". It can be a type of electrical transmission line implemented on printed board circuit technology or multi-chip modules (MCM). Transmission line acts as an interconnect between various devices on platform. When we excite one terminal of it, the wave will propagate through it to other terminals. Figure 5.7 shows the transection of the basic model of a microstrip line with E and H field distribution.

In this section, I will solve the electric potential distribution on a microstrip line.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Microstrip_fieldlines}
\end{figure}
\begin{center}
	\small fig 5.7 E and H field distribution on a microstrip line 
\end{center} 
The two-dimensional electrostatic field problems are governed by the two-dimensional Poisson equation
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\epsilon_r\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x})-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(\epsilon_r\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}) = \frac{\varrho}{\epsilon_0}
\end{equation}
where $\varrho$ denotes the charge density, and $\epsilon_r$ denotes the relative permittivity. The geometry and mesh of the microstrip model is shown in fig 5.8 and fig 5.9
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Microstrip_geometry}
\end{figure}
\begin{center}
	\small fig 5.8 Geometry information of the microstrip line

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{MicrostripeMesh}
\end{figure}
\begin{center}
	\small fig 5.9 mesh of the microstrip line
\end{center} 
Note that since the model, and  governing equations are symmetric, hence I can reduce the solution domain by half by applying the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition at the plane of symmetry.

From figure 5.8, the width of the metal is 0.11mm, with thickness be 0.04mm. I used copper as the metal whose conductivity if 4.0$\times$10$^7$ S/m. The height of substrate is 0.06mm with the material whose relative permittivity is 3.\\

As a simplification we can assume that both electric and magnetic fields are orthogonal to z-direction, in which the wave propagates in transverse electro-magnetic mode (TEM). Therefore we can decompose the transmission line into discrete segments along the z-direction and analyze the distribution on the cross section. \\

The boundary condition of this model requires classified discussion. First is the boundary on the surface of metal. For a electrostatic problem, since I am interested in electric potential distribution, I can set the potential on the surface to be 1 V because it is equipotential on the surface of good conductors, and the potential to be 0 on the ground surface. On the interface of substrate and air, as potentil jump can lead to infinite electric field intensity, it must follow the Neumann boundary as $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = 0$. The most difficult one is the outer boundary. For most of the cases microstrip line is within an relatively open or unbounded domain, which means field must vanish at boundaries and no reflection is allowed. Hence, a perfect matching layer will be the optimal choice, which is often used in radiation and antenna problems. For simplicity here I let the outer box to be large enough and use Dirichlet boundary contion. The result of electric potential distribution is shown in figure 5.10.

\begin{center}

\end{center} 

This time I have no way to obtain the analytical solution. For checking the correctness of FEM solution I solve the same problem via COMSOL. The result from COMSOL is shown in figure 5.11. We can have a intuitive impression that the result from my solver is fairly close to the result solved by COMSOL. Note that we don't care about the potential distribution inside the metal while COMSOL still calculate them out.

\subsection{FEM to Quasistatic Problem: Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines}
Analysis of multiconductor transmission lines is an important problem for the design of high-frequency integrated circuits. For transmission lines made of lossy conductions, we can employ a quasistatic analysis that keeps the conduction current and ignores the displacement current introduced by electromagnetic induction. With this approximation, ${\textbf{E}}$ $\approx$ -j$\omega$${\textbf{A}}$, where $\textbf{E}$ is the electric field,  $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\textbf{A}$ is the vector potential defined by ${\textbf{B}}$ = $\bigtriangledown$$\times$${\textbf{A}}$. From Maxwell's equations, we can obtain
\begin{equation}
\bigtriangledown \times(\frac{1}{\mu_r}\bigtriangledown \times A_z \hat{z})+j \omega \mu_0 \sigma A_z \hat{z} = \mu_0 \bar{J}_{imp} \hat{z}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ denotes the conductivity of the lossy conductors and $\hat{J}$$_{imp}$ is the impressed current along the longitudinal direction (for this problem is z direction). Conductors are made of aluminum-oxide with $\sigma$ = 3.6$\times$10$^7$ and $\mu_r$ = 1. With relation  ${\textbf{E}}$ $\approx$ -j$\omega$${\textbf{A}}$, (32) can be written as
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\partial^2 {A_z}}{\partial {x^2}} - \frac{\partial^2 {A_z}}{\partial {y^2}} + j \omega \mu _0 \sigma A_z = \mu_0 \sigma E_{imp}
\end{equation}
The information of geometry and mesh of the multicondutors transmission line model are shown in figure 5.12 and 5.13
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{center} 
Note that I used two region of mesh, the outer one is of coarse mesh size while the inner one is of finer mesh size. The boundary condition here for any interface can be set as Neumann boundary condition. With the system of elements, I excited the conductors one by one with E$_{imp}$ = 1 and $\omega$ = 10 MHz to  obtain the electric field distribution among the region. As usual, I compare my numerical solution with the result from COMSOL, as is shown in figure 5.14 to 5.17 (Here I only show the result when excit)

Compare the solutions from my FEM solver and COMSOL, they are fairly close to each other. Hence My algorithm is relatively reliable like commercial softwares.

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.

\section{Conclusion}
Through this paper, I implemented finite element method for solving the following problems: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1-dimensional Poisson equation: I solved it with FEM and finite difference method. The convergence analysis shows that with linear interpolation and center-difference, both FEM and FD have a 2$^{nd}$ order accuracy; with quadratic interpolation FEM has a 3$^{rd}$ order accuracy; while with cubic interpolation FEM has a 4$^{th}$ order accuracy.
	\item 2-dimensional Poisson equation: I solved it with FEM and compared with analytical solution. 
	\item 2-dimensional Microstrip Line: I solved it with FEM and compared with result from COMSOL.
	\item 2-dimensional Transmission Line: I solved it with FEM and compared with result from COMSOL.
\end{itemize}
The comparison shows my FEM algorithm is reliable for the correct solution which is close to the commercial software. However, it also took much longer time than COMSOL when solving the two-dimensional cases. Hence more modification is needed for improving the performance.

This paper would not have been possible without the zealous support from Prof. Mary Pugh as well as my supervisor, Prof. Piero Triverio. Prof. Pugh helps me with convegence analysis of higher order element and Prof. Triverio helps me with understanding physics model of multiconductor Transmission Line.
